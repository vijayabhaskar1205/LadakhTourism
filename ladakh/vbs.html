    the India-China border.This pristine and endorheic lake is 134 km long, which extends from India to China. The prime attraction 
    of the lake is its changing color over the duration of the day and this crystal blue lake offers glimpses
     of the mighty surrounding peaks in the lake, which is a unique experience.</h2></p>

     <p><h2>Also known as ‘Cyclops Hill’, Magnetic Hill is renowned for the phenomenon that defies
     the law of gravitation. The hill road is downhill and when you park your vehicle in a box there, 
     it seems like the vehicle rolling uphill in the defiance of gravity. 
     Located on Srinagar Leh Highway, Magnetic Hill is the best place
     to visit in Ladakh and to get captivated by this phenomenon.
